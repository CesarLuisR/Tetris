# 🎮 Tetris Clone

A simple Tetris clone built in C++ because why not? Blocks fall, lines vanish, and time disappears. It’s everything you’d expect from a proper time sink.

## 🚀 Build Instructions

You can build this project using:

- 🛠️ **Visual Studio** build system (just open the `.sln` and hit build)
- 💻 Or with a good ol’ terminal:
  ```bash
  g++ *.cpp -o tetris
  ```
  
  ```⚠️ Nice try running this on Linux or macOS environments :)```
It was definitely born and raised on Windows. Cross-platform? Maybe later...
